For campers we offer a pitch in the middle of nature on a hill in the beautiful Alentejo. It can be reached via a 5km long dirt road, which is easy to drive on when it is not raining too heavily. The site is in the shade of a beautiful cork oak and is about 500 meters from our 2 inhabited houses. We live on the property with 4 free-roaming, peaceful, bright and sociable dogs who, apart from greeting our guests, mostly stay near the house. The area offers: Odemira about 20 minutes by car, Sao Luis about 15 minutes by car, the sea about 30 minutes by car, hiking trails , access to Pego das Pias

Large unpaved parking area next to the Intermarche. Almost flat, view of the surrounding area and flock of sheep in front of the door. However, it is loud. Loud music, dog barking and cat screaming and early in the morning, the Intermarche supplying trucks, allowed us only a little sleep.

On the banks of the Rio Mira. It's a perfectly normal and exceptionally quiet parking area where campervans are tolerated, provided they are self-sufficient! Odemira has created a beautiful spot here. Located directly on the river, with park-like grounds and sun umbrellas on the riverside lawn, it's a lovely place to relax. The new pedestrian bridge provides quick access to the town. An art exhibition on the opposite bank is one of the attractions. On a hilltop stands a 12.5m x 6m sculpture, the Monumento ao Cante Alentejano, depicting a regionally typical choir, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Bars, pubs, a supermarket, two gas stations, and several other shops complete the offerings.

Zone P is lower down. We had dinner and spent the night. In the morning, the GNR arrived, greeted us, but didn't say anything. It's a quiet parking lot next to the river below the bridge. We tried the one above, which is also flat, but cars kept passing by, so we decided to go there. It's a rough dirt road that seems steep, but with the 7.60m AC, we made it down and up just fine.

A trampoline for children's fun is also available. Enjoy the relaxation and peace! Good internet connection available. Are you interested in mud construction or life in Portugal?

The exchange of experiences is not included in the overnight price. Overnight stay without exchange of experiences: €10. Overnight stay with exchange of experiences: €50.  Location: In the village of Luzianes, there is a small shop for basics . There is a public shower/restroom that you can use.

Place on a street, which hardly disturbs. We wanted to stay 2 nights and ended up staying 11 nights. Everything fits here, the market hall opposite the entrance, a launderette, Spar and a Portuguese supermarket 200m away. Very nice place, great cheap restaurants, very nice people everywhere. The sea is within walking distance, we had the bikes with us. Great backcountry. Sanitary older but good and clean. A plus for us, there are no dogs on the site. Value for money is good here.

Advance reservation required. We look forward to welcoming you to Monte Parreira. Monte Parreira is a high-altitude property near São Teotónio with wonderful views over part of the Alentejo. We are happy to provide one or two overnight pitches free of charge. Access is no problem for four-wheel drive vehicles; others need sufficient weight on the drive axle to negotiate the steeper sections of the approach without difficulty. The view makes up for this. We speak German, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, and Italian.

603985,"NM - Natured Minds

Warm welcome to Quinta NM  A natureful farm stay for you who long to retreat into nature and experience off-grid living. Nestled in the mountains above Odeceixe, close to Aljezur, Monchique and São Teótonio, our space offers refreshing lake swims and gravelled pitches overlooking the wild coast of the Costa Vicentina Natural Park. Whether you’re looking for an overnight stay or a deeper pause in nature, you are warmly welcome to land, ground, and rediscover your connection with the natural world. A vast land of biodiversity awaits you – among cork oaks, wild olive trees, rock roses, pine trees and fruit tree orchards. You can park next to our lake and ground yourself on your private earth terrace, or choose our mountain plateau – both with breathtaking sea views on a clear day. Fall asleep to frog lullabies, awake to birdsong, enjoy free access to fresh water and seasonal greens, play and relax by the lake beach of your choice, unwind in the chill out forest, and watch the sunset on your terrace. We are gently developing a regenerative living space based on permaculture – a place to reconnect people with nature for both human and planetary well-being. Your stay supports this vision and invites you to nature your mind to nurture your soul. ⸻ What we offer: • Panoramic sea and mountain views • Accessible parking on our mountain plateau or next to our grounding earth terraces and ruin facilities  • Access to fresh water • Shaded outdoor living room • Forest chill-out area • A freshwater lake • Recycling and compost station • Fire-free safety zone • Pets welcome  ⸻ Stay details: • Contact us beforehand to reserve your spot and to receive route recommendations. Please note that the gps doesn’t always show the best road. From the north and west the best road is through the north entry of São Teotónio. From the south the best is through Aljezur in direction to Marmelete - Selão - São Teotónio. From the east through Marmelete towards São Teotónio.

Welcome to Pereiras-Gare! I offer a Park4night spot for one camper  with a beautiful view overlooking the landscape with Cork Oaks and Strawberry trees . Enjoy the solitude surrounded by nature. Out of sight behind a crest you will find my garden and chickens and an old ruin that I am working on. Feel free to bring your dog, mine are very playful. I have a limited water supply for myself, but if you need 20l, just ask. You can also refill water in Santa Clara or Sao Marcos, only 15min drive from Pereiras. These little villages have nice restaurants too. In Pereiras, a 15 minutes walk away, you will encounter two small shops and two cafés. Please give me a call to find out the easiest access to the spot.

Very beautiful view of the valley, sunset on the mountains ... Sheltered from the wind, sun but a little shade on the sides of the chapel.
