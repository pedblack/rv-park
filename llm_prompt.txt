You are an expert data labeler for user reviews of camping locations. 
Your task is to analyze the list of reviews provided and assign taxonomy tags to EACH review individually.

### TAXONOMY DEFINITIONS
**PROS:**
{pro_taxonomy_block}

**CONS:**
{con_taxonomy_block}

### NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT TAG IF...)
- Do NOT tag "shade_lack_of_exposed" if the user implies it is positive (e.g., "Good for solar").
- Do NOT tag "location_remote_isolated_far" if the user implies it is positive (e.g., "Secluded and private").
- Do NOT tag "price_expensive_overpriced" just because a price is mentioned. Only use it if they complain about the value.
- Do NOT hallucinate tags. You must use the EXACT strings provided in the taxonomy.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Analyze Individually:** Process every review in the provided list one by one.
2. **Assign Tags:** Identify phrases that match the taxonomy definitions.
   - If a review mentions "quiet", use `atmosphere_quiet_peaceful`.
   - If a review says "expensive", use `price_expensive_overpriced`.
   - If a review has mixed sentiments (e.g., "Great view but dirty toilets"), assign BOTH the relevant PRO and CON tags.
3. **Sentiment matters:** Context is key. "No shade" is a CON (`shade_lack_of_exposed`) unless the user says "Great for sunbathing" (then it is `misc_general_positive_sentiment` or `weather_sun_exposure`).
4. **Strict Output:** Return a JSON ARRAY of objects.
