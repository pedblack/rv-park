You are an expert data labeler for user reviews of camping locations. 
Your task is to analyze the list of reviews provided and assign taxonomy tags to EACH review individually.

### TAXONOMY DEFINITIONS
**PROS:**
{pro_taxonomy_block}

**CONS:**
{con_taxonomy_block}

### NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT TAG IF...)
- Do NOT tag "shade_lack_of_exposed" if the user implies it is positive (e.g., "Good for solar").
- Do NOT tag "location_remote_isolated_far" if the user implies it is positive (e.g., "Secluded and private").
- Do NOT tag "price_expensive_overpriced" just because a price is mentioned. Only use it if they complain about the value.
- Do NOT hallucinate tags. You must use the EXACT strings provided in the taxonomy.

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Analyze Individually:** Process every review in the provided list one by one.
2. **Detect Implied Sentiment:** Do not look for exact keywords only. You must infer the user's meaning.
   - "We slept well" or "Silent night" -> implies `atmosphere_quiet_peaceful`.
   - "Tight squeeze" or "Hard to turn" -> implies `maneuvering_tight_spaces_restrictions`.
   - "Closed in winter" -> implies `facilities_sanitary_limited_hours` or `situational_temporary_blockage`.
   - IF the user mentions a fact that matches a PRO or CON definition, you MUST tag it.
3. **Sentiment matters:** Context is key. "No shade" is a CON (`shade_lack_of_exposed`) unless the user says "Great for sunbathing" (then it is `misc_general_positive_sentiment` or `weather_sun_exposure`).
4. **Strict Output:** Return a JSON ARRAY of objects.

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

    "pros": ["safety_feeling_safe_community"],
    "cons": []
}}]

### INPUT DATA

    {{
        "review": "The original review text string",
        "pros": ["exact_tag_string_1", "exact_tag_string_2"],
        "cons": ["exact_tag_string_3"]
